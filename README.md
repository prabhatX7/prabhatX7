# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hello there! I'm Prabhat Karki , a passionate student diving into the world of programming and currently focusing on mastering JavaScript.<br><br>🚀 I'm on an exciting journey of learning and exploring the ins and outs of JavaScript, from the basics to more advanced concepts like asynchronous programming and modern frameworks like React and Node.js.<br><br>💼 As a student, I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skill set in the field of web development. I'm currently honing my skills through various online courses, tutorials, and personal projects.<br><br>🌱 In my free time, you'll often find me immersed in coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode or contributing to open-source projects to gain practical experience and give back to the community.<br><br>📫 Have any tips or resources to share? Or perhaps you're looking for a study buddy to tackle JavaScript projects together? Feel free to reach out to me via email at lpk.edition@gmail.com.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I enjoy with watching reels, movies and playing video games.
